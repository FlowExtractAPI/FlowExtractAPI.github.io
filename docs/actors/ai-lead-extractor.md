## 🎭 Two Operating Modes

### 1️⃣ Normal Mode - Web Scraping

**When to use**: Extract data from live websites

**How it works**:
- Launches a full browser using Playwright
- Navigates to your specified URLs
- Extracts content using AI or basic regex patterns
- Captures screenshots for reference
- Returns structured data in your preferred format

**Best for**: Company websites, contact pages, product listings, competitor analysis

**Example**:
```json
{
  "startUrls": [
    {"url": "https://apify.com/about"},
    {"url": "https://example.com/contact"}
  ],
  "useAI": true,
  "aiInstructions": "Extract company description, CEO name, and all contact information"
}
```

**Result**: Structured data with company info, contacts, and a screenshot of each page

---

### 2️⃣ Standby Mode - Data Analysis

**When to use**: Analyze existing data without web scraping

**How it works**:
- No browser launched (faster and cheaper)
- Accepts any data format: JSON, CSV, text, XML, HTML
- AI analyzes and transforms your data
- Returns processed results in seconds
- Cost-effective for pure data processing tasks

**Best for**: Data transformation, format conversion, text analysis, report generation

**Example using API**:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://dz-omar--ai-lead-extractor.apify.actor?token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": "Company A: info@companya.com, +1-555-0100\nCompany B: contact@companyb.com, +1-555-0200",
    "aiInstructions": "Extract as JSON array with company name, email, and phone"
  }'
```

**Result**: Instant JSON transformation without any web scraping overhead

**Key Difference**: 
- **Normal Mode** = Browser required, processes URLs, memory billing applies
- **Standby Mode** = No browser, processes your data, no memory billing for creator

## 💰 Pricing & Billing

### Understanding Costs

This actor has two billing components:

1. **Memory-Based Billing** (Normal Mode only)
2. **AI Word-Based Billing** (when AI is enabled)

---

### 1. Memory-Based Billing (Normal Mode Only)

**Charged every 30 seconds** based on allocated memory. Does NOT apply in Standby Mode.

| Memory | Events per 30s | FREE Tier | GOLD Tier | Savings |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 128 MB | 1 | $0.0008 | $0.0002 | 75% |
| 256 MB | 2 | $0.0016 | $0.0004 | 75% |
| 512 MB | 4 | $0.0032 | $0.0008 | 75% |
| 1024 MB | 8 | $0.0064 | $0.0016 | 75% |

**Formula**: Events = Memory (MB) ÷ 128

**Example**: Running at 256 MB for 2 minutes
- **FREE tier**: 4 intervals × 2 events × $0.0016 = **$0.0128**
- **GOLD tier**: 4 intervals × 2 events × $0.0004 = **$0.0032** (75% savings)

---

### 2. AI Word-Based Billing

**Charged per 1,000 words processed** when AI is enabled.

| Type | FREE | BRONZE | SILVER | GOLD |
|------|------|--------|--------|------|
| Input Words (per 1K) | $0.0015 | $0.0012 | $0.0010 | $0.0008 |
| Output Words (per 1K) | $0.0045 | $0.0036 | $0.0030 | $0.0024 |

**Conversion**: ~1 token = 0.75 words (approximately 4 characters)

**Example AI extraction** (typical page):
- **Input**: 2,836 words (page content)
- **Output**: 2,606 words (extracted data)
- **FREE tier**: $0.00425 + $0.01173 = **$0.01598**
- **GOLD tier**: $0.00227 + $0.00625 = **$0.00852** (47% savings)

---

### Complete Cost Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Extraction (No AI)
**Scenario**: Extract contacts from 5 pages, 2 minutes total, 256 MB memory

- **Memory Cost** (FREE): $0.0128
- **AI Cost**: $0 (AI disabled)
- **Total**: **$0.0128**

---

#### Example 2: AI Extraction - Free Tier
**Scenario**: AI extract from 3 pages, 3 minutes total, 256 MB memory

- **Memory Cost**: 6 intervals × 2 events × $0.0016 = **$0.0192**
- **AI Cost** (3 pages avg): 3 × $0.016 = **$0.048**
- **Total**: **$0.0672**

---

#### Example 3: AI Extraction - GOLD Tier
**Scenario**: Same as Example 2, but with GOLD subscription

- **Memory Cost**: 6 intervals × 2 events × $0.0004 = **$0.0048**
- **AI Cost** (3 pages avg): 3 × $0.0085 = **$0.0255**
- **Total**: **$0.0303** (55% savings vs FREE)

---

#### Example 4: Standby Mode - Data Analysis
**Scenario**: Analyze CSV data with 5,000 words

- **Memory Cost**: $0 (no browser in Standby)
- **AI Cost** (GOLD): ~$0.005
- **Total**: **$0.005**

**Note**: In Standby Mode with PPE (Pay-Per-Event), the user pays execution costs, not the creator.

---

### Upgrade Benefits

| Feature | Free Tier | Paid Tiers (BRONZE/SILVER/GOLD) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Basic Extraction | ✅ Always included | ✅ Always included |
| AI Model | Simple (OpenRouter) | **Advanced (higher accuracy)** |
| AI Billing | Pay-per-use | **20-47% discounts** |
| Memory Rates | Standard | **Up to 75% savings** |
| AI Accuracy | Good | **Superior** |
| Complex Instructions | Limited | **Excellent** |
| Support Priority | Standard | **Priority response** |

---

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Use Basic Extraction First**: If you only need emails/phones, disable AI to save costs
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple URLs in one run to amortize startup costs
3. **Lower Memory**: Start with 256 MB and increase only if needed
4. **Upgrade for Volume**: If processing 50+ pages/month with AI, paid tiers save money
5. **Use Standby Mode**: For data analysis tasks, Standby Mode avoids memory charges

### Memory Allocation Guide

Choose memory based on your needs:

| Memory | Use Case | Typical Speed | Cost (FREE) |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| 128 MB | Simple pages, no JS | 15-30 sec | $0.0008/30s |
| 256 MB | **Recommended default** | 10-20 sec | $0.0016/30s |
| 512 MB | Complex JS sites | 5-10 sec | $0.0032/30s |
| 1024 MB | Heavy pages, many images | 3-7 sec | $0.0064/30s |

**Recommendation**: Start with 256 MB. Increase only if you see timeout errors or slow performance.

---

### Handling Large Datasets

**Batch Processing** (Normal Mode):
```json
{
  "startUrls": [
    {"url": "https://site1.com"},
    {"url": "https://site2.com"},
    {"url": "https://site3.com"}
    // ... up to 1000+ URLs
  ],
  "useAI": true,
  "aiInstructions": "Extract contacts"
}
```

**Pagination Support**:
```json

    {"url": "https://example.com/page?p=3"}
  ]
}
```

---

### Error Handling & Retries

The actor automatically handles common errors:

- **Timeouts**: Automatic retry with increased timeout
- **Network errors**: 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **AI failures**: Graceful fallback to basic extraction
- **Invalid URLs**: Skipped with error logged

**Error Output Example**:
```json
{
  "url": "https://invalid-site.com",
  "error": "Page timeout after 60 seconds",
  "errorType": "TIMEOUT",
  "basicExtraction": null,
  "scrapedAt": "2025-01-10T14:30:00.000Z"
}
```
