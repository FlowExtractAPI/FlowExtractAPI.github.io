## ⚙️ How It Works

The Actor processes your input URLs and downloads each file using optimized strategies. It first attempts downloads through your configured proxy settings (if enabled), then falls back to direct connections if needed. Each file is streamed directly to Apify's Key-Value Store, providing you with secure, publicly accessible URLs for immediate use.

Files are processed sequentially to ensure optimal performance and memory usage. The Actor continues processing even if individual downloads fail, providing detailed results for each URL including success status, file information, and download statistics.

## 🌐 Using Standby Mode

The Actor can be deployed in standby mode to create a persistent HTTP API server that stays active and ready to process requests instantly.

### Available API Endpoints

**Health Check**
- `GET /health` - Returns server status and uptime information
- `GET /api/status` - Detailed server configuration and statistics

**File Download**
- `POST /api/download` - Process download requests with JSON payload

**Landing Page**
- `GET /` - Serves a static HTML page with general information about the API

### API Request Format

Send POST requests to `/api/download` with the same JSON structure as normal Actor input:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-actor-id.apify.actor/api/download" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "URLItem": [
      {
        "url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qDnkaAzi5gE/hqdefault.jpg"
      },
      {
        "url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8mQPABefJ5k/hqdefault.jpg"
      }
    ],
    "uniqueFileNames": true,
    "proxyConfig": {
      "useApifyProxy": false
    }
  }'
```

**Important**: Always use the `/api/download` endpoint for file download requests. Sending POST requests to the root path `/` will result in a "Cannot POST /" error.

### Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using your Apify API token, which can be provided as:
- URL parameter: `?token=YOUR_TOKEN`
- Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### Response Format

The API returns the same detailed JSON response as normal Actor execution, including download status, file information, and secure storage URLs.

### Integration Benefits

**Webhook Integration**: Perfect for processing download requests from external systems and automation workflows.

**Real-time Processing**: No cold start delays - requests are processed immediately as the server stays warm.

**Scalable API**: Handle multiple requests efficiently with proper resource management and error isolation.

## 🌐 Proxy Benefits

**Bypass Restrictions**: Access geo-blocked content and overcome IP-based limitations using residential proxies.

**Avoid Rate Limits**: Distribute requests across multiple IP addresses to prevent rate limiting and blocking.

**Enhanced Privacy**: Mask your real IP address and location when downloading sensitive or restricted content.

**Improved Reliability**: Automatic proxy rotation and fallback mechanisms ensure consistent download success.

## 🔐 Unique Filename Feature

### How It Works

The unique filename feature prevents file overwrites by appending a short hash to each filename:

1. **Hash Generation**: Creates a 6-character MD5 hash from the full URL
2. **Deterministic**: Same URL always produces the same hash
3. **Format**: `{originalName}-{hash}.{extension}`
4. **Example**: `hqdefault.jpg` → `hqdefault-a3f5c2.jpg`

### Why Use It?

**Problem**: Downloading multiple files with the same name causes overwrites
```
❌ hqdefault.jpg (from URL 1)
❌ hqdefault.jpg (from URL 2) ← overwrites the first one
❌ hqdefault.jpg (from URL 3) ← overwrites again
```

**Solution**: Each file gets a unique identifier
```
✅ hqdefault-a3f5c2.jpg (from URL 1)
✅ hqdefault-7b92d1.jpg (from URL 2)
✅ hqdefault-e4c8f9.jpg (from URL 3)
```

### When to Disable

Set `uniqueFileNames: false` if:
- You're downloading a single file
- You want to overwrite existing files intentionally
- You're using custom `fileName` for each URL
- You need the exact original filename

## 🎬 HLS Stream Conversion

Automatically detects and converts Zoom HLS streams to MP4:

**Detection**: Checks for `.m3u8` URLs with `Origin: https://zoom.us` header
**Conversion**: Uses FFmpeg with header preservation
**Fallback**: Falls back to normal download if conversion fails
**Unique Names**: Also supports unique filename generation for converted videos

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

**Memory Efficient**: Streaming architecture handles files of any size without memory constraints or buffer limitations.

**Sequential Processing**: Downloads are processed one at a time to optimize performance and prevent resource conflicts.

**Header Configuration**: Include appropriate User-Agent and authentication headers for better compatibility.

**Proxy Selection**: Choose residential proxies for geo-restricted content, datacenter proxies for general use.

**Error Handling**: Review failed downloads and adjust configurations based on error messages.

**Resource Monitoring**: Monitor your Key-Value Store usage and clean up old files when no longer needed.

## 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

**Files Overwriting Each Other**: Ensure `uniqueFileNames: true` is set in your input (it's the default).

**Authentication Errors**: Ensure proper headers and tokens are included for protected resources.

**Geo-blocking**: Enable proxy support with appropriate country targeting to bypass restrictions.

**Large Files**: The streaming architecture handles large files efficiently, but monitor timeout settings.

**Rate Limiting**: Use proxy rotation or reduce concurrent requests to avoid being blocked.
