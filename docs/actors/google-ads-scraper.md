## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No Results Returned
**Possible Causes:**
- Advertiser ID doesn't exist or has no public ads
- Region filter too restrictive
- Date range excludes all ad activity
- Domain has no verified Google Ads presence

**Solutions:**
- Verify advertiser ID format (AR followed by 20 digits)
- Try removing region/date filters first
- Search by keyword instead of domain
- Check Google Ads Transparency manually first

### Slow Performance
**Possible Causes:**
- Many search targets with unlimited results
- No rate limiting enabled
- Network latency without proxy

**Solutions:**
- Set reasonable `resultsPerQuery` limits
- Enable Apify Proxy for faster processing
- Reduce `maxAdvertiserAccounts` per keyword
- Split large jobs into smaller batches

### Proxy Errors
**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient proxy credits
- Wrong proxy group selected
- Proxy blocked by Google

**Solutions:**
- Verify Apify account has proxy credits
- Use RESIDENTIAL proxy group for best results
- Try without proxy for small tests
- Contact Apify support for persistent issues
